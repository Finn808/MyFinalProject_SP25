    "\n",
    "Wolfson et al. (2011) explored the “Quarterback Prediction Problem” and concluded that many draft outcomes do not align with actual NFL performance.

It also features attributes such as 40-yard dash time, bench press reps, vertical jump, broad jump, 3-cone drill, shuttle run, height, and weight. This dataset serves as a comprehensive resource that evaluates physical and athletic capabilities of NFL prospects. These performance variables will be used to explore their predictive relationship with draft outcomes and long-term success in the NFL. \n",

    "  - Number of variables: 10\n",
    "  - Description: This dataset records players drafted between 2000 and 2022, with fields for draft year, round, overall pick number, team, player name, and position. When merged with the NFL Combine dataset, this will enable analyses that assess how measurable pre-draft attributes affect draft position and NFL career outcomes.\n",

    "The data required to answer our research question, which is whether a quarterback's college statistics and NFL combine performance can predict their likelihood of being drafted, is primarily sourced from publicly available databases maintained for the most part by the NCAA, NFL, and third party sports analytics organizations. These sources provide performance metrics such as college passing efficiency, rushing yards, and NFL combine results sources like the 40 yard dash, vertical leap, which are legally collected and publicly reported. So the data is considered ethical to use within the bounds of this project. Additionally, previous academic research such as Craig & Winchester (2021) used similar types of performance data to investigate draft outcomes, leading support to the relevance of these data sources. However, even though the data itself is public, we remain cautious about how combinations of variables like the college, height, and combine scores could make certain players identifiable,especially in smaller groups.To mitigate these concerns, we will consider recoding variables to reduce specificity like grouping schools by conference or categorizing physical metrics into ranges and avoid drawing attention to specific individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis will focus on identifying performance related patterns associated with being drafted without implying judgment of players' inherent ability or value. The intention isn’t to reinforce or replicate scouting but to explore whether certain quantifiable features are consistently correlated with draft status. However, as noted in the background of the project, scouting and drafting processes themselves are not always rational or objective. For example Craig & Winchester (2021) found that rushing ability among quarterbacks is often undervalued despite its significant contribution to NFL success, suggesting the presence of bias in talent evaluations. Wolfson (2021) argued that the NFL draft outcomes are affected by both randomness and the overvaluation of certain traits, which can affect long term success predictions. As well as the overrepresentation of athletes from elite conferences or the undervaluation of mobile quaterbacks may reflect broader systemic inequities. Therefore we will audit our data for imbalances, for example between Power Five and non Power Five conferences, and avoid including features that serve as proxies for race or socioeconomic status unless we are explicitly analyzing their impact on our data. Our goal is not to predict player “worth” but to better understand how past decisions have been made and if there's any patterns, can we use those patterns to predict accurately if they will be drafted?"
