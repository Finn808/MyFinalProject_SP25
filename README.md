# 🏈 Predicting NFL Draft Outcomes for College Quarterbacks

### 👤 Personal Version by [Finn808](https://github.com/Finn808)

This repository contains my personal version of a group project originally developed for **COGS 108 (Spring 2025)** at **UC San Diego**.  
The project explores whether a college quarterback’s **NFL Combine metrics** and **college statistics** can accurately predict their chances of being drafted into the NFL.

## 📘 Project Overview

**Research Question:**  
> To what extent can a quarterback’s college performance metrics and NFL Combine results predict their likelihood of being drafted into the NFL, and which specific features (e.g., college QBR, rushing statistics, 40-yard dash time) are most strongly associated with this outcome?

We utilized datasets from both the **NFL Combine** and **NCAA college football statistics**, conducting an **exploratory data analysis** to identify potential key predictors of draft outcomes.

Our analysis focused on:
- **Total Yards**
- **Interceptions**
- **Touchdown-to-Interception Ratios**
- **Height and Weight Measurements**
- **40-Yard Dash Times**

After examining these factors, we concluded that while certain trends exist among drafted players, **no single metric consistently predicts whether a college quarterback will be drafted**. Instead, the results suggest that the draft process is influenced by a more complex combination of performance, athleticism, and contextual factors.
